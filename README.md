# Basic Python Calculator

This repository contains two basic calculator programs written in Python:

* **`basicCalculator.py`:** A command-line interface (CLI) calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo).
* **`calcGUI.py`:** A graphical user interface (GUI) calculator built using the `tkinter` library. It provides a visual way to perform the same basic arithmetic operations.

## How to Use

### Command-Line Calculator (`basicCalculator.py`)

1.  **Save the file:** Save the code as `basicCalculator.py` on your local machine.
2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command.
3.  **Run the script:** Execute the calculator by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
    ```bash
    python basicCalculator.py
    ```
4.  **Follow the prompts:** The calculator will display a menu of operations. Enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform and then enter the two numbers when prompted.
5.  **Continue calculating:** The calculator will continue to run until you choose the "Exit" option.

### Graphical User Interface Calculator (`calcGUI.py`)

1.  **Save the file:** Save the code as `calcGUI.py` on your local machine.
2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command.
3.  **Run the script:** Execute the GUI calculator by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
    ```bash
    python calcGUI.py
    ```
    This will open a calculator window.
4.  **Use the buttons:** Click the number buttons and operator buttons to build your expression.
5.  **Equals button:** Click the "=" button to see the result.
6.  **Clear button:** Click the "C" button to clear the display.
7.  **Keyboard input:** You can also use your keyboard to type numbers and operators. Press Enter for "=" and Escape for "C".

## Further Improvements (Future Ideas)

Here are some potential future improvements for these calculators:

* More advanced mathematical operations (exponents, square root, trigonometric functions, etc.).
* Error handling for invalid input in the GUI.
* Memory functions (MC, MR, M+, M-).
* Calculation history.
* More sophisticated GUI styling and themes.
* A safer method for evaluating expressions in the GUI (instead of `eval()`).
